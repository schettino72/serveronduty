======

* the integration_id in the job's row is not being saved.
* we also need to save started, and elapsed for integration rows
* it seems there is a problem with "started" and "elapsed" columns not being the correct type sqlalchemy is expecting
* needs lots of cleanup
* remove hard-coded stuff specific for NBET
* write tests

* job page
* all pages need more work
* the DB design needs to be re-tough. it is not really mapping well to the reality
